**Catherine O'Brien** lives in New York City and is interested in everything. She is an artist, writer, and engineer, and her poetry has been recognized by the 2022 Quarto Chapbook Contest, Echoes Magazine, and others. She holds a BA in Computer Science from Barnard College. You can probably find her in a bookstore reading the first three pages of everything or at Coney Island swimming before it's seasonally appropriate.
